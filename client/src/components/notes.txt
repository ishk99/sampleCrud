Routing used for components:

1. For URL / default routing we use BrowserRouter from react-router-dom
2. Wrap the whole app with it.
3. Use Route on components to create a path-- Change of URL changes the component
4. To make the tabs clickable - use NavLink
Wrap components in the NavBar with NavLink and in the "to" property metion the route
